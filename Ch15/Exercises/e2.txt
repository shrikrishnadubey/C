Which of the following should not be put in a header file? Why not?

(a) Function prototypes
(b) Function definitions
(c) Macro definitions
(d) Type definitions

Answer:
B. Function definitions shouldn't be in header files because when the function
is modified, any source files that included the function's header file would
need to be recompiled. Normally that would only be the case if the function's
prototype was modified.
