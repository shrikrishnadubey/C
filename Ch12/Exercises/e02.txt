Suppose that high, low, and middle are all pointer variables of the same type,
and that low and high point to elements of an array. Why is the following
statement illegal and how could it be fixed?

middle = (low + high) / 2;

Answer:
It's illegal because pointers can only be subtracted from eachother.

middle = low + (high - low) / 2;
