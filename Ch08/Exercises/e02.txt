The Q&A section shows how to use a letter as an array subscript. Describe how
to use a digit (in character form) as a subscript.

Answer:
Using a digit as an array subscript is very similar to using a letter. Instead
of array[letter - 'a'] for a letter, it becomes array[digit - '0'] for digit
characters.
