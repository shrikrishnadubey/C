We discussed using the expression sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0]) to calculate the
number of elements in an array. The expression of sizeof(a) / sizeof(t), where
t is the type of a's elements, would also work, but it's considered an inferior
technique. Why?

Answer:
Because the latter expression is less flexible. Now if someone decides to
change the datatype of the array, they'll have to change t to that datatype in
every subsequent expression.
