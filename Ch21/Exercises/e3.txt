When a macro hides a function, which must come first in the header file: the
macro definition or the function prototype? Justify your answer.

Answer:
The function prototype must always come first, because otherwise the function
name in the prototype will be expanded as a valid macro by the preprocessor.

For example, say these were hypothetically defined in a header in the following
order:

#define add_nums(x,y) ((x) + (y))
int add_nums(int x, int y);

After preproccessing, the prototype would become

int ((x) + (y))(int x, int y)

which is obviously erroneous
