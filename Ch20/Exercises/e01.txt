Show the output produced by each of the following program fragments. Assume that
i, j, and k are unsigned short variables.

(a) i = 8; j = 9;
    printf("%d", i >> 1 + j >> 1);
(b) i = 1;
    printf("%d", i & ~i);
(c) i = 2; j = 1; k = 0;
    printf("%d", ~i & j ^ k);
(d) i = 7; j = 8; k = 9;
    printf("%d", i ^ j & k);

Answer:
A - 0
B - 0
C - 1
D - 16
