If n is an unsigned int variable, what effect does the following statement have
on the bits in n?

n &= n - 1;

Hint: Consider the effect on n if this statement is executed more than once.

Answer:
It removes the least significant 1 bit of n.
If n is 1010, it will become 1000 because:

  1010
  1001
   &=
  1000

If this is executed more than once, it can be used to do something based on how
many 1s are in a bit field.
