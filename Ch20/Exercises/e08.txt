Let f be the following function:

unsigned int f(unsigned int i, int m, int n)
{
  return (i >> (m + 1 - n)) && ~(~0 << n);
}

(a) What is the value of ~(~0 << n)?
(b) What does this function do?


Answer:
A - The value is 2 ^ n.
B - It returns a bit-field within i of length n starting at position m.
    Positions are assumed to be numbered starting from the rightmost bit, which
    is position 0.
