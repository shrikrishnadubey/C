Suppose that f and p are declared as follows:

struct {
  union {
    char a, b;
    int c;
  } d;
  int e[5];
} f, *p = &f;

Which of the following statements are legal?

(a) p->b = ' ';
(b) p->e[3] = 10;
(c) (*p).d.a = '*';
(d) p->d->c = 20;

Answer:
A - Illegal because the variable b is inside the union d, not directly in f.
    Should be: p->d.b = ' ';

B - Legal

C - Legal

D - Illegal because d isn't a pointer.
    Should be: p->d.c = 20;
