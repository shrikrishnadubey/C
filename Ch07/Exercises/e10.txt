Suppose that i is a variable of type int, j is a variable of type long, and
k is a variable of type unsigned int. What is the type of the expression
i + (int) j * k?

Answer:
j is first explicitly converted from a long to an int.
Then the expression becomes (int) + (int) * (unsigned int). Which is much more
simple.

The expression should evaluate to unsigned int in the end.
