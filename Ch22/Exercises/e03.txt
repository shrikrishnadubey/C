Find the error in the following program fragment and show how to fix it.

FILE *fp;

if (fp = fopen(filename, "r")) {
  read characters until end-of-file
}
fclose(fp);

Answer:
The error is that fclose attempts to close a NULL pointer when fopen fails.

Corrected version:
FILE *fp;

if (fp = fopen(filename, "r")) {
  read characters until end-of-file
}
else {
  printf("Error opening file: %s\n", filename);
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
fclose(fp);
