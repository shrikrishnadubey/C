The following loop appears in the fcopy.c program:

while ((ch = getc(source_fp)) != EOF)
  putc(ch, dest_fp);

Suppose that we neglected to put parentheses around ch = getc(source_fp):

while (ch = getc(source_fp) != EOF)
  putc(ch, dest_fp);

Would the program compile without an error? If so, what would the program do
when it's run?

Answer:
Some compilers will warn you if warning checks are enabled, but the program will
compile without error.

When the program is run,

(ch = getc(source_fp) != EOF)

will become (ch = 1) or (ch = 0) based on how

getc(source_fp) != EOF

is evaluated. This happens because the relational operators (== and !=) have
higher precedence than the assignment operator (=).

So the new file will have the same number of characters, but because of how ch
is assigned, every character will be the ASCII character 1 aka SOH (start of
heading).
