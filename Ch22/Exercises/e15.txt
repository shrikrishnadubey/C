Write calls of fseek that perform the following file-positioning operations on
a binary file whose data is arranged in 64-byte "records." Use fp as the file
pointer in each case.

(a) Move to the beginning of record n. (Assume that the first record in the file
    is record 0.)
(b) Move to the beginning of the last record in the file.
(c) Move forward one record.
(d) Move backward two records.

Answer:
A - fseek(fp, 64*n, SEEK_SET);
B - fseek(fp,  -64, SEEK_END);
C - fseek(fp,   64, SEEK_CUR);
D - fseek(fp, -128, SEEK_CUR);
