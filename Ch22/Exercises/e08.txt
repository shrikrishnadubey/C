In the previous chapters, we've used the scanf format string " %c" when we
wanted to skip white-space characters and read a nonblank character. Some
programmers use "%1s" instead. Are the two techniques equivalent? If not, what
are the differences?

Answer:
They're nearly identical, but %s will add a null character at the end, since
it's a string and strings are null terminated.
