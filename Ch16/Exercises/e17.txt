Suppose that b and i are declared as follows:

enum {FALSE, TRUE} b;
int i;

Which of the following statements are legal? Which ones are "safe" (always yield
a meaningful result)?

(a) b = FALSE;
(b) b = i;
(c) b++;
(d) i = b;
(e) i = 2 * b + 1;

Answer:
A - Legal

B - Illegal because i is uninitialized, and has an unknown value

C - Illegal because b is uninitialized

D - Illegal because b is uninitialized

E - Illegal because b is uninitialized
