Suppose that str is an array of characters. Which one of the following
statements is not equivalent to the other three?

(a) *str = 0;
(b) str[0] = '\0';
(c) strcpy(str, "");
(d) strcat(str, "");

Answer:
D is not equivalent, because it leaves the string the same, while the other
three erase the string by setting it's first character to null.
