The following function supposedly creates an identical copy of a string.
What's wrong with the function?

char *duplicate(const char *p)
{
  char *q;

  strcpy(q, p);
  return q;
}

Answer:
It's wrong because q was never set to point anywhere, and it's a local
variable, meaning it's gone after the function is over.
